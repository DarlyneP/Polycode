# Polycode
28/06/2023

I coded this website on the fly for a couple of hours while playing around with Vue.js in the most simple way (creating an app & mounting it, no automatic initialization of the project).

I've been learning several languages & figured some months ago it could be quite practical to have a platform that gives people code examples of how to do something in different languages, it's good for code culture & hepls the learning process too (this was before chatGPT took over, now you just have to ask haha. I still wanted to practice around & code my idea though.).

I had some things to get to prior so I'm doing this only now, as a rough draft to showcase my skills & get more familiar with Vue. This is my first Vue project since I obtained my Vue.js certification on Codecademy but I plan on using this framework more to do more elaborate things.

Again this website is a rough draft of what my initial project could be.

Update :

the code won't compile properly on Github pages for some reason so here is a quick visual until I can fix this issue later this week
